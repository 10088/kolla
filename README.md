A proof of concept demonstrating deployment of OpenStack Services within Docker
containers using Kubernetes on Project Atomic.


Getting Started
=================

Kubernetes deployment on bare metal is a complex topic which is beyond the
scope of this project at this time.  The developers still require a test
environment.  As a result, one of the developers has created a Heat based
deployment tool that can be found here:

Directories
=================

* docker     - contains artifacts for use with docker build to build appropriate images
