Welcome to Kolla's Documentation!
=================================

Kolla provides Docker containers and Ansible playbooks to meet Kolla's mission.
Kolla is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete
customization. This permits operators with little experience to deploy
OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack configuration to
suit the operator's exact requirements.
